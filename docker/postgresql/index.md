# PostgreSQL and Docker

Whenever you want to work with PostgreSQL on docker, you might want to go through those steps:
1. [creating a new postgresql container](creatingAPostrgreSQLDockerContainer.md)
2. (if available) [export a database from a existing container and import it into your new container](exportAndImport.md)
3. [connect your container with intellij](connectWithIntelliJ.md)
