# What is docker

Well, glad you asked, but who does really know? It seems to be magic. 

## Info 
As you might guess, this page is way over simplified and is intended to give you a broad idea so you can start with docker with a first impression and a rough idea what is going on.  

## What is it good for?

Well, that's a bit easier to describe. Basically allows you to run encapsulated little operating systems in so called **containers**.
That allows you to not only to simulate other platforms (e.g. those from your customer), but also do work on a Windows machine while using Linux applications.

If you break one of those containers (or simple missconfigure it), your machine will still work. 

Also, we can export those containers into so called  **images**. 

Images (if you are not familiar with the term) are basically save-files. 
You can actually export (see [here](step3/exportDocker.md)) and import (see [here](step1/importDockerImage.md)) them.
