# Oracle Database with docker


I work with Windows, so if you work with some other OS, sometimes some small adaptation might be needed, but the commands of docker and docker-compose will be absolutely the same. 

# Step 0: Download and install Docker Desktop

Go to docker.com, download and install. 

You will need admin rights.

# Step 1: Get the docker image

## Option 1:

Pull a docker image from a repository. E.g. see [https://github.com/MaksymBilenko/docker-oracle-12c](https://github.com/MaksymBilenko/docker-oracle-12c)

## Option 2:
[Use a provided Docker Image from archive](step1/importDockerImage.md)

## Option 3:
[Create a new Docker image from scratch](step1/createOracleDockerImage.md)


# Step 2: Run the Docker Container

# Bonus: Committing an Exporting
