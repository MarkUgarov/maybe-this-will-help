# Oracle Database with docker

## Info (i)

The creation of the original Docker Image was basically done by some basic knowledge about docker and reading the following links:
- https://github.com/steveswinsburg/oracle19c-docker
- https://www.martinberger.com/2020/09/windows-10-wsl-2-docker-and-oracle-a-perfect-partnership/

I work with Windows, so if you work with some other OS, sometimes some small adaptation might be needed, but the commands of docker and docker-compose will be absolutely the same. 

# Step 0: Download and install Docker Desktop

Go to docker.com, download and install. 

You will need admin rights.

# Step 1: Get the docker image

## Option 1:
[Use a provided Docker image](step1/importDockerImage.md)

## Option 2:
[Create a new Docker image from scratch](step1/createOracleDockerImage.md)

# Step 2: Run the Docker Container

# Bonus: Committing an Exporting
